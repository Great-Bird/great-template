## Quick Start

### Tools

To begin, you will need to install [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/releases),
the toolchain manager used for this project template. Rokit is a newer alternative to
Aftman/Foreman which does not require manually typing out manifests for tools.
See https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit for documentation and installation instructions.

After you've installed Rokit, if you haven't already, run
```bash
rokit self-update
```
to get the latest version of Rokit. Next, run
```bash
rokit install
```
in the VSCode terminal, and press Y to trust each tool when prompted. This should
install every needed tool for using this project template.

Note: If confused while using CLI tools, you should be able to run them with the
`--help` flag (e.g. `rokit --help`) to view usage instructions. Here are some example
usage instructions for Rokit (run in a Git Bash terminal):
```bash
great@Birdnest MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/great-template (main)
$ rokit --help
Next-generation toolchain manager for Roblox projects

Usage: rokit.exe [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  add           Adds a new tool to Rokit and installs it
  authenticate  Authenticate with an artifact provider, such as GitHub
  init          Initializes a new Rokit project in the current directory
  install       Adds a new tool using Rokit and installs it
  list          Lists all existing tools managed by Rokit
  self-install  Installs / re-installs Rokit, and updates all tool links
  self-update   Updates Rokit to the latest version
  system-info   Prints out information about the current system and installed tools
  trust         Mark the given tool(s) as being trusted
  update        Updates all tools, or specific tools, to the latest version
  help          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -v, --verbose...
  -h, --help        Print help
  -V, --version     Print version
```

### Configuration

There is a bit of project-specific configuration to do. First, run
```bash
code .lune/config.luau
```
to open up the configuration script (alternatively, you can open it up using the
file explorer). It might look something like this:
```lua
return {
    -- Project-specific options. These are required to be set.
    placeId = 0, -- The place ID of the game to download on `lune run setup import`

    -- File path options. It's fine to leave these at their defaults.
    buildFilePath = "build.rbxlx", -- The path to the build file to write to on `lune run setup import`
    projectFilePath = "default.project.json", -- The path to the project file to serve on `lune run setup`
    sourceCodeDirectoryPath = "src", -- The path to the source code directory
    sourcemapFilePath = "sourcemap.json", -- The path to the rojo sourcemap file
    typeDefinitionsFilePath = "globalTypes.d.luau", -- The path to write the global type definitions file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/main/scripts/globalTypes.d.luau
}
```
Change `placeId` to your game's Roblox place ID. Optionally, change any of the
file paths according to your preference.

### Dependencies

You may have a few tools or packages in mind which you would like to use in this
project.

#### Tools
Let's say you want to install [Blink](https://github.com/1Axen/blink), a CLI tool
which automatically generates high-performance Roblox networking code from a file
describing your RemoteEvents. To do this, you can run
```bash
rokit add 1Axen/Blink
```
which will add Blink to your `rokit.toml` and install the tool. Now you're able
to use it in your project!

#### Roblox Packages
Now let's say you're actually something of a performant network code fanatic, and
you want to use [Squash](https://data-oriented-house.github.io/Squash/) to compress
down the data you're sending to your clients even further. To do this, you can
open `pesde.toml`, and under the `[dependencies]` section, add
```toml
Squash = { wally = "data-oriented-house/squash", version = "VERSION" }
```
where `VERSION` is the latest version of Squash (example: 2.5.0). After running
```bash
lune run install
```
Squash will be downloaded to the `roblox_packages` folder, and now you're ready
to blow the world away by building your crazy efficient networked multiplayer
game!

### Final Setup

Now that you hopefully have everything installed, run
```bash
lune run setup import
```
to set everything else up as needed. You should see something like this appear in
the output:
```bash
great@Birdnest MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/great-template (main)
$ lune run setup
âœ… Downloaded global type definitions
âœ… Installed packages
âœ… Created sourcemap
All tasks completed!
The development environment has been set up!
Warning: build.rbxlx does not exist. It's recommended to run with the 'import' flag to ensure the latest version of the main place is imported.
ðŸ”„ Changes are syncing. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```
Follow the instructions, and now you're ready to make your game!

Whenever you open this project in VSCode, make sure to run `lune run setup`.
Passing the `import` flag is only necessary if there were changes made in the
main place which you would like to edit with.

Note: The main place (i.e. the one you specified the place ID of in `config.luau`) holds
the source copy of the game's DataModel. Changes to Instances in a local file
(such as `build.rbxlx`) will not automatically update the main place. If you want
to make changes to the game's Instances, make your changes in the main place, and
run `lune run setup import` and re-open the build file.
